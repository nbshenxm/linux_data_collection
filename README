Before running the code, make sure sysdig, lua5.1 and luasocket are proporly installed. (Ubuntu has those packages, run "sudo apt install <selected package>")

To set up sysdig data collection (default port: 8080):
1. run "gcc server.c -o server" to get a server executable
2. run "./server"
3. run "sysdig -c countsc.lua"

NOTE: 
1. The sysdig Chisel "countsc.lua" is just a prototype with limited functionality. However, additional functionalities like filtering can be easily added.
2. The server "server.c" currently stuout all data it receives. The data received can be saved to a file, or processed in real-time with small modification.
